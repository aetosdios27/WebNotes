## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.17 or later)  
- npm (or your favorite package manager)  
- A PostgreSQL database URL (e.g., from Neon)  

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aetosdios27/WebNotes.git
cd WebNotes
````

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following variables.

```bash
# 1. Database Connection String (from Neon)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."

# 2. Auth.js Secret (generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
AUTH_SECRET="your-strong-random-secret"

# 3. Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id-from-google"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret-from-google"

# 4. NextAuth.js URL (for local development)
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Sync the Database

Push the Prisma schema to your database. This will create all the necessary tables.

```bash
npx prisma db push
# (You may also need to run `npx prisma generate` after installing dependencies)
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
